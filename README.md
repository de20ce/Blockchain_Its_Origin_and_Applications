# Blockchain Its Origin and Applications

This is a course on `Blockchain, Its Origin and Applications` That I gave during he second edition of the Summer School in Artificial Intelligence initiated by *La Fondation Vallet*, *Benin Excellence* and *UNDP*.

# Why this course?

At a time when freedoms are being fought the most, it is becoming more and more obvious that a solution to the problem of the economy (of money in particular) could be the global creation of an open source economy: it would seem that this is the state of consciousness that Satoshi Nakamoto, the father of bitcoin, would like to see. Even if we are still very far from it today, I dare to believe that developers, or even ourselves, will seriously think about it in the years to come. For me, it is clear that the bitcoin price panic sounds like a singularity in the testament that Nakamoto left us. That's not the point at all. In that case, what is the point? Without getting into philosophical considerations, I dare to believe that there are basically two points (and I'm not saying that this would be what Nakamoto thinks): Do we really need a digital currency? How could a digital currency lead to an evolution of our collective consciousness? Those are the two main points right now, I'd like us to sit down and think about. These two points are the message.
